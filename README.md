# robotServer
This is a robotics experiment, where I try to create a webserver that also functions as a moveable robot.
If you're interested and want to download this server, after cloning use this command 'pip -r install requirements.txt' after you've navigated to this folder.

Prototype is up and running on: http://80.212.145.134:5000
